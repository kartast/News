                <p>Jürgen Siebert and Maurice Meilleur, writing for Typographica:</p><blockquote><p>Typographic aesthetes will be happy to learn that support for
                kerning and ligatures (Apple calls these macros “font
                descriptors”) will be turned on throughout iOS 7, effortlessly
                accessible even over very advanced visual effects like the
                deceptively real-looking handmade paper texture. […]</p><p>But the hottest typographic number in iOS 7 is Dynamic Type. As
                far as I know, Apple’s mobile products will be the first
                electronic devices that will by default consider a quality of type
                that hasn’t been given so much attention since the age of
                letterpress. That’s right: we’re talking about an operating
                system, not an application or a layout job. It’s true, optical
                sizes were tried in photosetting and desktop publishing &#8212; but
                they weren’t really automatic, and some of the attempts turned out
                to be blind alleys (like Adobe Multiple Masters). And yes, there
                are any number of displays in industry products that use different
                ‘grades’ of text for smaller and larger settings. But optical
                sizing in iOS builds on these earlier attempts and offers
                astonishing possibilities.</p></blockquote><p>Text Kit makes me very happy.</p><div><a  title="Permanent link to ‘The Real Story Behind Fonts in iOS 7’"  href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/07/08/ios-7-type">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a></div>

                <p>Rene Ritchie:</p><blockquote><p>Back before WWDC 2013 rumors started to spread about iOS 7
                providing access to third-party keyboard makers. This rumor might
                originate, in part, from a question Tim Cook answered at the D11
                Conference about third-party APIs (application programming
                interfaces). It might also have to do with &#8220;leaks&#8221; that came out
                just prior to WWDC claiming at least a couple Android keyboard
                makers were getting ready to port to iOS.</p><p>WWDC, however, passed without mention of third-party keyboards for
                iOS (but with an awkward car demo!). Whether third party keyboards
                were never on the agenda, or the &#8220;leaks&#8221; got them kicked off the
                agenda, or they may indeed be on the agenda for a future event is
                tough to say. All we can say is that Apple hasn&#8217;t announced any
                third-party keyboard support for iOS, not open to every developer,
                not tied to limited partners, nothing.</p></blockquote><p>My understanding is that third-party keyboards were never on the agenda for iOS 7, or at least they were never planned for what was announced at WWDC. Nothing along these lines got yanked. The main issue Apple faces is security: a third-party keyboard would &#8220;see&#8221; everything you type, in every app you use. Regular apps you download from the App Store are sandboxed; third-party keyboards couldn&#8217;t be sandboxed in the same way apps are.</p><p>Plus there&#8217;s the user interface question of how you&#8217;d install them. Right now, everything you download from the App Store is an app that shows up as an object on your homescreen. Where would a keyboard go? I&#8217;m not saying these are particularly hard problems to solve, but just that Apple hasn&#8217;t solved them, and so thus there are no third-party iOS keyboards.</p><div><a  title="Permanent link to ‘Regarding Third-Party Software Keyboards for iOS’"  href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/07/05/third-party-keyboards">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a></div>

                <p>Jon Pareles, writing for the NYT:</p><blockquote><p>When installed, it demanded a working log in to Facebook or
                Twitter and permission to post on the account. “We would like fans
                to share the content through social networking sites,” a Jay-Z
                spokeswoman said by e-mail. (E-mail to Samsung Mobile’s customer
                service address for the app was returned as undeliverable
                throughout Wednesday.) But the app was more coercive.</p><p>In the days before the album’s release through Samsung, the app
                promised to display lyrics &#8212; with a catch. “Unlocking” the lyrics
                required a post on Facebook or Twitter. I used Twitter, where
                hitting the “Tweet” button brought up a canned message: “I just
                unlocked a new lyric ‘Crown’ in the JAY Z Magna Carta app. See
                them first. http://smsng.us/MCHG2 #MagnaCarta.” The message could
                be altered, but something had to be sent. No post, no lyrics &#8212;
                for every song. Users were forced to post again and again. And
                frankly, a lyric that is going to show up almost immediately on
                the Internet isn’t much of a bribe for spamming your friends.</p></blockquote><p>I&#8217;m not surprised Samsung would go for this, but I am that Jay-Z would.</p><div><a  title="Permanent link to ‘Jay-Z Magna Carta App/Album, Only for Samsung Phones’"  href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/07/05/jay-z-samsung">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a></div>

                like a lovely, smooth carpet &#8212; and is also completely unreadable.
                While iOS does let users adjust font sizes throughout the system,
                it may be a bad sign if many or most people choose to increase

At least twice in the past year, in public remarks, I&#8217;ve noticed Cook refer to customer satisfaction as &#8220;customer sat&#8221; &#8212; and it&#8217;s rare for Apple executives to drop into jargon on-stage. I suspect it&#8217;s a tell that he uses the term so frequently that he can&#8217;t help it. I know many people are nervous about the long-term effects of a &#8220;numbers guy&#8221; running Apple, but what makes Cook a good fit is that he&#8217;s most obsessed with the right kind of numbers: those that attempt to quantify how happy Apple&#8217;s customers are.</p><div><a  title="Permanent link to ‘Apple Leads Smartphone Customer Satisfaction Survey — in Korea’"  href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/07/02/korea-customer-sat">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a></div>

The first is the fonts themselves, which they&#8217;ve painstakingly tweaked to render beautifully, even at small sizes, across all modern operating systems and display types.

                upgrading the BlackBerry PlayBook tablet to its latest mobile OS,
                BlackBerry 10. CEO Thorsten Heins revealed the sour news on the
                company&#8217;s investor call relating to today&#8217;s earnings report,
                though he didn&#8217;t delve into the specifics of why the company&#8217;s
                plans have changed. The only justification offered by Heins is
                that BlackBerry was unable to get performance up to a satisfactory
                level, and the company now intends to focus on core products
                instead.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://mashable.com/2011/05/06/playbook-amateur-hour/">BlackBerry ad campaign for the Playbook, in May 2011</a>: &#8220;Amateur hour is over.&#8221;</p><div><a  title="Permanent link to ‘Amateur Hour Still Not Over’"  href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/07/01/amateur-hour">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a></div>

                <p>Dave Hamilton, writing for The Mac Observer:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Alright, time for everyone to use the bathroom,&#8221; my father used
                to say on road trips. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t have to,&#8221; was the inevitable
                whine from (at least) one of us kids. Dad&#8217;s reply was always the
                same: &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t a question.&#8221;</p><p>My dad was focused on being as efficient as possible, of course.
                Instead of stopping for just one person to pee and then getting
                back on the road, it makes way more sense to have everyone pee at
                each stop. That at least prevents the inevitable inefficiency
                introduced ten minutes later when the next person feels nature
                urging them along.</p></blockquote><div><a  title="Permanent link to ‘Dave Hamilton on iOS 7&#8217;s Coalesced Updates’"  href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/06/27/hamilton-pee-break">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a></div>

                <p>Marco Arment:</p><blockquote><p>The theme is clear: iOS 7’s UI requires some of Apple’s biggest
                strengths, and efforts to copy it will be hindered by some of
                Android’s biggest weaknesses.</p><p>iOS 7 is also going to be a problem for cross-platform frameworks.
                Fewer assumptions can be made about the UI widgets and behaviors
                common to all major platforms. And any UI targeting the least
                common denominator will now look even more cheap and dated on iOS
                7, since the new standard on the OS is so far from the old one.</p></blockquote><p>Similar line of thinking to <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/06/26/pike">Allen Pike&#8217;s piece yesterday</a>.</p><div><a  title="Permanent link to ‘iOS 7 as Defense’"  href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/06/27/ios-7-as-defense">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a></div>

            <![CDATA[
                <p>Google engineer Ray Cromwell, responding a month ago to my &#8220;<a href="http://daringfireball.net/2013/05/google_versus">Google Versus</a>&#8221; piece, &#8220;<a href="https://plus.google.com/110412141990454266397/posts/LS1P3G9jUCz">Hardcore Apple Fans and Siege Mentality</a>&#8221;:</p><blockquote><p>Just got back from I/O and I run into a Twitter thread where
                Farhad Manjoo, John Gruber, et al are criticizing a strawman
                Larry&#8217;s Q&amp;A session where Larry talks about negativity in the
                tech press.</p></blockquote><p>Looking forward to hearing what that straw man is.</p><blockquote><p>There&#8217;s an underlying current of siege mentality in the Apple
                blogger world, after years of teetering on the brink, Apple made a
                come back, but its hardcore users lived under a constant perceived
                threat by Microsoft, and Steve Jobs cultivated a cult like
                tribalist view of the community when it came to competing
                ecosystems as a defense, not unlike I think governments that whip
                up nationalist or patriotic fervor.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2013/05/google_versus">My piece</a> he&#8217;s referring to had nothing to do with Apple. I did mention iPhone and Android, but only as one example of Google following the lead of others, commoditizing existing markets, the opposite of Larry Page&#8217;s onstage edict that &#8220;We should be building great things that don’t exist.&#8221;</p><blockquote><p>Now with Apple as the most successful company in the world, they
                still can&#8217;t shake the amygdala urge to fight anyone in their space
                as an enemy. Case in point, John Gruber refers to anyone who
                criticizes Apple in the slightest as a jackass, if you run a
                search restricted to Daring Fireball for that keyword, the search
                results are ten pages long.</p></blockquote><p>I have indeed used &#8220;jackass&#8221; to describe numerous people over the years, including a stretch circa 2006-2007 when I regularly named a &#8220;Jackass of the Week&#8221;. But I strongly believe that a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=site:daringfireball.net+jackass">perusal of the DF archive</a> would show that I have never used the word jackass to describe &#8220;anyone who criticizes Apple in the slightest&#8221;. There are indeed many search results on Daring Fireball for &#8220;jackass&#8221;, but I regret almost none of them. I&#8217;ve used the word very deliberately, and I hope consistently, to describe people who are, in fact, jackasses. To call a jackass a jackass may be impolite, but it is not inaccurate or unfair.</p><p>My dictionary defines <em>jackass</em>, in the non-donkey sense, merely as &#8220;a stupid person&#8221;. To my mind, the word also conveys a sense of willfulness &#8212; to be not merely stupid but willfully stupid. In many cases, I&#8217;ve used it to describe people who wrote stupid things that I suspect they did not actually believe to be true, but that they wrote these stupid things to be purposefully sensational, to draw attention to themselves and to their writing.</p><p>I can think of no better word than <em>jackass</em> to describe, to name one recent example, Peter Cohan of Forbes, who has <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/10/01/cohan-jackass">argued</a> (<a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/01/22/cohan-forbes">repeatedly</a>) that Apple&#8217;s board of directors should fire Tim Cook. First, that&#8217;s a preposterously stupid idea. Second, I suspect that Cohan himself knows that it&#8217;s a stupid idea, and that he makes this argument only because making such an argument with an ostensibly straight face draws a lot of attention. He either honestly believes Apple&#8217;s board should fire Tim Cook, or he&#8217;s purposefully wasting his readers&#8217; attention with an argument he knows to be sensational nonsense. Either way, he&#8217;s a jackass.</p><p>That said, a perusal of my use of the word <em>jackass</em> on DF will also show that I have used the term much less frequently over the last several years, despite the fact that jackassery (Apple-related or otherwise) is more rampant than ever. It was easier for me to use strong words like <em>jackass</em> years ago, when I was writing in relative obscurity, than it is today. Daring Fireball&#8217;s popularity creates the perception that my calling someone a jackass is not calling a spade a spade &#8212; which is always and only what I&#8217;ve intended &#8212; but rather a form of bullying &#8212; which is clearly how Cromwell, for example, sees it.</p><p>My tendency toward bluntness, however warranted by the facts, results in a loss of persuasion among those who confuse bluntness with shrillness.</p><blockquote><p>To a siege mentality, everything is zero sum.</p></blockquote><p>Again, I reiterate, my piece that Cromwell is referring to had almost nothing to do with Apple. It really was just about Google, and what I perceive to be their institutional hypocrisy and self-deception. Google is the company that has pitted itself as a rival to every other major player in the industry.</p><p>Rational followers, customers, and even fans of Apple are not concerned in the least that Apple will any day soon again &#8220;teeter on the brink&#8221;. (As a point of fact, the company &#8220;teetered on the brink&#8221; just once, from 1996-97, and with the exception of a few hiccup quarters, have been remarkably successful ever since.) In fact, close followers of Apple should be more concerned not with Apple <em>losing</em> its powerful position atop the industry, but rather with their <em>abusing</em> it.</p><p>One recent example: this bit, exposed during the e-book price-fixing trial (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/15/technology/us-now-paints-apple-as-ringmaster-in-its-lawsuit-on-e-book-price-fixing.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">as reported by the New York Times</a>):</p><blockquote><p>In July 2010, Mr. Jobs, Apple’s former chief executive, told the
                chief executive of Random House, Markus Dohle, that the publisher
                would suffer a loss of support from Apple if it held out much
                longer, according to an account of the conversation provided by
                Mr. Dohle in the filing. Two months later, Apple threatened to
                block an e-book application by Random House from appearing in
                Apple’s App Store because it had not agreed to a deal with Apple,
                the filing said.</p><p>After Random House finally agreed to a contract on Jan. 18, 2011,
                Eddy Cue, the Apple executive in charge of its e-books deals, sent
                an e-mail to Mr. Jobs attributing the publisher’s capitulation, in
                part, to “the fact that I prevented an app from Random House from
                going live in the app store,” the filing reads.</p></blockquote><p>I find that worrisome. Not merely because it&#8217;s unfair (though it is; apps submitted to Apple&#8217;s App Store ought to be judged solely on their own merit) but because it is unhealthy. A new endeavor, such as the iBookstore, should be able to succeed on its own, without any unfair help from a separate Apple property such as the App Store. This path leads to hubris, and hubris inevitably leads to a fall.<sup id="fnr1-2013-06-20"><a href="#fn1-2013-06-20">1</a></sup></p><blockquote><p>Steve Jobs once said: &#8220;We did not enter the search business. They
                entered the phone business. Make no mistake they want to kill the
                iPhone. We won&#8217;t let them. This &#8216;don&#8217;t be evil&#8217; mantra is
                bullshit.&#8221; In this world, competition is about utterly destroying
                your enemy until they no longer exist, it&#8217;s evil, and Google and
                Apple were somehow supposed to have an unspoken &#8220;gentleman&#8217;s
                agreement&#8221; not to pursue each other&#8217;s markets.</p></blockquote><p>&#8220;Somehow supposed to&#8221;? Eric Schmidt was on Apple&#8217;s board of directors.<sup id="fnr2-2013-06-20"><a href="#fn2-2013-06-20">2</a></sup> There&#8217;s no &#8220;somehow&#8221; or &#8220;gentleman&#8217;s agreement&#8221; about it.</p><blockquote><p>But Larry Page is right, competition need not be a zero sum game,
                especially in circumstances where the market is growing. Note that
                while iPhone and Android are brutally battling it out in the
                smartphone market, both Apple, Google, and Samsung have all been
                enjoying year over year increases in earnings and user base. Yes,
                Nokia and Blackberry lost out, but that&#8217;s mostly because feature
                phones as a category are dying, and iPhone class smartphones were
                launched by them too late.</p><p>Overall, as far as Apple vs Android, so far, it has been positive
                sum for the two biggest fighters in the ring. Apple&#8217;s biggest
                problem at this point is not Android, but saturation and overly
                high expectations.</p></blockquote><p>Agreed. But, <em>again</em>, I repeat, I never said that Apple&#8217;s biggest problem is Android, nor that competition need be a zero sum game. The gist of my piece was not that Apple is good and Google is bad. The gist of my argument is that Google is a ruthless competitor that enters existing markets, upends them, and isolates itself with a seemingly unquenchable desire to dominate every single market in consumer online services; yet, hypocritically, its leadership describes Google as just wanting to get along, that Google is institutionally a <em>nice</em> company, and that they succeed by &#8220;building great things that don’t exist&#8221;, whereas what they actually do is build free versions of things that already exist and make money selling ads.<sup id="fnr3-2013-06-20"><a href="#fn3-2013-06-20">3</a></sup> Google employees self-identify as not-ruthless while acting ruthlessly, leading to cognitive dissonance.</p><blockquote><p>Gruber and others like to imagine that people who work at Google
                hate hate hate Apple products and want to destroy them, and that
                may be the mentality on the Apple side, but I don&#8217;t know many
                Googlers who spend time trying to devise plans to destroy the
                iPhone, many of them quite like iPads and use MacBooks and would
                be sad to see Apple fold.</p></blockquote><p>There is no chance that Apple is going to &#8220;fold&#8221;. No one is worried about that. That&#8217;s a very weird thought to have even occurred to Cromwell. And nobody thinks Google employees &#8220;hate&#8221; Apple products; it&#8217;s common knowledge that many use iPhones (<a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/07/17/mayer-roundup">including executives</a>) and many more use Macs.</p><blockquote><p>As Larry said, much of the focus is on problem solving, not being
                concerned with &#8220;destroying&#8221; competitors like you&#8217;d read in
                internal Microsoft memos. The world has perhaps never seen a
                corporation with management and culture like Google before in this
                sector, they can&#8217;t process it, and the cynic has to suspect it&#8217;s
                all bullshit, all a show.</p></blockquote><p>Consider the industry landscape today. Apple just announced iOS 7; it adds support at the system level for Flickr and Vimeo (in addition to Facebook and Twitter, which came last year). iOS 7 gets weather, sports, and financial news from Yahoo. Siri now integrates with Bing &#8212; Microsoft! &#8212; for web and image search results. Who are Google&#8217;s allies and partners? What services does Android or Chrome OS include at the system level except Google&#8217;s own?</p><p>Apple frequently highlights third-party apps in TV commercials and in marketing photos for its devices. When&#8217;s the last time Google has promoted third-party apps for Android? Have they ever?</p><blockquote><p>Speaking of solving problems and doing stuff that&#8217;s never been
                done before, Gruber says:</p><blockquote><p>Google is the company that built Android after the iPhone, Google
                Plus after Facebook, and now a subscription music service after
                Spotify. They entered the RSS reader market, wiped it out, and are
                now just walking away from it. Gmail? Webmail but better. Think
                about even web search: Google search wasn’t something new; it was
                something better. Way, way, way better, but still.</p><p>Consider maps. Google Maps entered a market where MapQuest and
                others had been around for years. That wasn’t something great that
                didn’t already exist. It was a better version of something that
                already existed.</p></blockquote><p>See the trick here? Google didn&#8217;t do anything that was&#8217;t done
                before. Gmail, Maps, Search, etc. Those are just refinements. But
                the iPhone? That&#8217;s an entirely new thing from wholecloth. We won&#8217;t
                say &#8220;the iPhone came after the Blackberry, after the Nokia
                Smartphones, after the PalmPhones&#8221;, we&#8217;ll just pretend they never
                existed.</p></blockquote><p>Clearly, I disagree with Cromwell almost entirely, but up until this point, I have tried to at least give him the benefit of the doubt in terms of his earnestness. But at this point it&#8217;s hard not to suspect that he&#8217;s just trolling.</p><p>It was Larry Page who said, on stage at I/O:</p><blockquote><p>Every story I read about Google is “us versus some other company”
                or some stupid thing, and I just don’t find that very interesting.
                We should be building great things that don’t exist.</p></blockquote><p>I suppose technically Page didn&#8217;t claim that Google actually <em>does</em> build great things that don&#8217;t exist, only that they (and everyone in attendance) <em>should</em>. But the implication certainly is there.</p><p>Of course Apple didn&#8217;t invent the smartphone. No one thinks they did; no one has ever claimed they did. That includes Apple. In fact, Steve Jobs specifically and joyfully cited all of the predecessors cited by Cromwell during the iPhone&#8217;s introduction in 2007. He even showed them off:</p><p><a href="/misc/2010/03/smartphones.jpg"><img
                src="/misc/2010/03/smartphones-415.jpg"
                alt="Steve Jobs at Macworld Expo 2007, showing the leading smartphones prior to the iPhone."
                /></a></p><p>Nothing better exemplifies what Apple does best: enter an existing market with a product that blows the competition away, through superior design and engineering.</p><blockquote><p>When does executing on something so radically better count as
                &#8220;never been done before&#8221;? Gmail and Maps were some of the first in
                a new class of Web 2.0 applications, a whole new class of
                interactivity for a web app. Do Google&#8217;s datacenters counter as
                having never been done before? Co-loc points for hosting servers
                go back to the first dot.com boom, but to compare one of those
                with the way Google&#8217;s Datacenters are engineered as just refining
                is completely ignoring the depth to which Google reinvented the
                datacenter.</p></blockquote><p>I agree with every word of this. Google&#8217;s success in these markets is based on the superiority of their offerings: the best web search, the best webmail, the best maps. <em>Enter an existing market with an overwhelmingly superior and hard-to-duplicate new product and destroy the competition.</em> That&#8217;s what Apple does, and that&#8217;s what Google does. That&#8217;s what almost all successful companies do. But it&#8217;s Page who expresses disinterest in and considers &#8220;stupid&#8221; stories that pit Google &#8220;versus some other company&#8221;.</p><p>The difference with Google is not the competitiveness, it&#8217;s the hypocrisy of denying the competitiveness. It feels trite to accuse Cromwell of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_projection">projection</a>, but if there&#8217;s a company and its &#8220;fans&#8221; who are engaged in a &#8220;siege mentality&#8221;, it&#8217;s not Apple.</p><blockquote><p>I for one am proud to be a googler because of things like the way
                Larry acquitted himself humbly, thoughtfully, and authentically at
                I/O. I&#8217;m glad he doesn&#8217;t engage in bitterness. Even if you think
                it&#8217;s fake spin, it&#8217;s still better than being an angry public
                jackass.</p></blockquote><p>Uh, exactly?</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2013-06-20"><p>When I linked to this NYT report a month ago, I quoted the same passage as above, but for my own commentary merely quipped, &#8220;Eddy Cue, hardball player.&#8221; That&#8217;s true, but it was lazy &#8212; and in hindsight I regret it, insofar as it does not suggest that I see this as the least bit troubling, when in fact I do.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr1-2013-06-20"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#8617;</a></p></li><li id="fn2-2013-06-20"><p>Perhaps Apple&#8217;s (and Steve Jobs&#8217;s) folly in this case &#8212; of Eric Schmidt serving on the Apple board while Google was working on Android &#8212; was not in trusting Schmidt to keep Android on track as a BlackBerry-like platform, but in thinking that this was even possible. In hindsight it should have been obvious to Apple that all phones would soon be modeled after the iPhone.

            <![CDATA[
                <p>No one has questioned whether Jony Ive can lead a hardware design team. Whether he could lead a software design team, however, has been the biggest question facing Apple over <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2012/10/forstall_out">the last eight months</a>. In fact, it might be the biggest question facing Apple, ever, because it&#8217;s another way of asking whether the company could produce innovative software without you-know-who at the helm of the ship.</p><p>Today, we have our answer, and it is a resounding yes. Jony Ive can lead a software team.</p><p>The key, I think, is that his approach, and Apple&#8217;s as a whole under its post-Forstall organizational structure, is not to view this as two different things, hardware and software, but rather as a single thing: design.</p><p>There is a deep intellectual rigor to the design of iOS 7, and it&#8217;s hard not to see it as being profoundly informed by Ive&#8217;s background in hardware. In hardware, design is limited by physics: weight, density, size, connections, seams. Software doesn&#8217;t face those design limits. The old design of iOS 6 took advantage of that lack of limits, to its detriment. In iOS 6, you open a folder on the home screen, and linen is something you see <em>underneath</em>. You pull down Notification Center, and linen is something you see <em>over</em>. It&#8217;s both over and under. Hardware doesn&#8217;t work like that, but software can, because software can show you anything, conceptual logic be damned.</p><p>The design of iOS 7 is based on rules. There&#8217;s an intricate system at work, a Z-axis of layers organized in a logical way. There is a profound reduction in the use of faux-3D visual effects and textures, but iOS 7 is anything but flat. It is three dimensional not just visually but logically. It uses translucency not to show off, but to provide you with a sense of place. When you pull the new Control Center panel up from the bottom of the screen, its translucency lets you know that you haven&#8217;t gone somewhere new, you&#8217;re just looking at something <em>over</em> where you were.</p><p>There&#8217;s a sense of place, depth, and spatiality in iOS 7 that makes it feel like hardware. A real thing, not pixels rendered on glass. It&#8217;s as though Ive has brought the same design goals that have always informed Apple&#8217;s hardware to software. And here, his team isn&#8217;t limited by physics. Planes can have zero thickness. But it&#8217;s a <em>system</em>, in the truest sense of the word.</p><p>iOS 7 is not perfect; this new design framework will evolve and improve over time, just like iOS&#8217;s original aesthetic did. But it&#8217;s a conceptual foundation that corrects all of the excesses of the original iOS aesthetic. It&#8217;s radically different but not disorienting. Less flashy, less bling, more subtle, more refined. </p><p>This is the first product of the post-Jobs Apple. The result shows that in some ways Apple&#8217;s software design has gotten <em>better</em>, because it was Jobs (and Forstall) who had a penchant for exuberant textures and gimmickry. Jobs&#8217;s taste in hardware was nearly perfect, but his taste in software <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/10/26/more-texture">had a weakness for the saccharine</a>. Wood grain, linen, Rich Corinthian leather, etc. It was all just sugar for the eyes. This is a weakness Jony Ive’s software taste clearly does not suffer.</p><p>The software is now of a piece with the hardware. Two sides of the same coin. Not hardware design and software design. Just design.</p>

            <![CDATA[
                <p>Tim Cook, one year ago, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/5/29/3051521/tim-cook-apple-will-double-down-on-secrecy-on-products">to Walt Mossberg</a>: &#8220;We&#8217;re going to double down on secrecy on products.&#8221;</p><p>12 months later, here we are, on the cusp of WWDC 2013, and nobody outside Apple seems to have any idea what Apple is set to show tomorrow. Cook&#8217;s words to Mossberg were anything but empty. The most secretive company in the industry got more secretive. We know Jony Ive has been leading the software design of iOS and OS X. We can be pretty sure they&#8217;re going to show us what they&#8217;ve been up to. But no one seems to know just what that is. </p><p>Yours truly included &#8212; and I couldn&#8217;t be happier. I haven&#8217;t been this in the dark about what Apple was set to announce in a keynote since the original iPhone introduction in January 2007. I&#8217;ve seen some speculation over the past few days that <a href="http://vesperapp.co/">Vesper</a>&#8217;s UI was informed by advanced knowledge of iOS 7. It was not. In fact, if anything, I expect Apple to zig where we (Q Branch) have zagged, in some ways. (And if iOS 7&#8217;s reveal does make Vesper seem at least somewhat presciently designed, chalk it up simply to our being able to tell which way the design wind is blowing.)</p><p>The thing to focus on &#8212; now, during the anticipatory lull, and tomorrow, once we have the actual design before us &#8212; is not merely what it looks like. The quote I keep coming back to is this classic from Steve Jobs, 10 years ago: &#8220;Most people make the mistake of thinking design is what it looks like. People think it&#8217;s this veneer &#8212; that the designers are handed this box and told, &#8216;Make it look good!&#8217; That&#8217;s not what we think design is. It&#8217;s not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.&#8221;</p><p>Whatever has changed in iOS 7 has changed for reasons other than fashion, or difference for the sake of difference.</p><p>The original iPhone was designed for a world where smartphones were horrid little button- and scroll-wheel-driven devices, and where proper humane computer interfaces were driven by mouse and trackpad cursors. The iPhone blended the two &#8212; the size and cellular networking of the smartphone, the humaneness of Mac-style UI design &#8212; and did so by introducing something new. The touchscreen.<sup id="fnr1-2013-06-09"><a href="#fn1-2013-06-09">1</a></sup></p><p>The design of the iPhone software was entirely informed by the fact that this was a new experience, it was nothing like using an existing smartphone, nor anything like using a Mac or Windows PC. It needed training wheels to get people up to speed. Thus, to name one small example, why iOS buttons have tended to look so very button-y. To inform the user, as clearly as possible, that this is a button that can be tapped.</p><p>Look around you. Any street corner. Any office. Any shopping mall. Any restaurant. You will see people tapping on touchscreens. We all get it now. iOS-style computing is no longer novel; it is now the standard interaction model for personal computing.</p><p>The primary problem Apple faced with the iPhone in 2007 was building familiarity with a new way of using computers. That problem has now been solved. It is time to solve new problems.</p><p>The training wheels can now come off. That&#8217;s what I think Apple&#8217;s going to do tomorrow.<sup id="fnr2-2013-06-09"><a href="#fn2-2013-06-09">2</a></sup></p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2013-06-09"><p>No, Apple did not invent the touchscreen. But the iPhone was first product to bring a touchscreen to the mass market. It was the first touchscreen device that mattered.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr1-2013-06-09"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#8617;</a></p></li><li id="fn2-2013-06-09"><p>I&#8217;ve been thinking mostly about iOS 7. But a new version of OS X is due as well. Last year they showed 10.8 months in advance; this year, nothing. So I think big changes are coming to the Mac as well. But what? I have no idea. None.</p><p>Exciting.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr2-2013-06-09"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">&#8617;</a></p></li></ol></div>

                <p><a href="http://www.technovia.co.uk/2013/05/apple-versus-after-john-gruber.html">Ian Betteridge spoofed my &#8220;Google Versus&#8221; piece from yesterday</a>, using this oft-cited quote from Steve Jobs speaking at Macworld Expo back in 1997:</p><blockquote><p>“We have to let go of this notion that for Apple to win, Microsoft
                has to lose,” Jobs said. “We have to embrace the notion that for
                Apple to win, Apple has to do a really good job. If others are
                going to help us, that’s great. Because we need all the help we
                can get. […] The era of setting this up as a competition between
                Apple and Microsoft is over.”</p></blockquote><p>Betteridge is off the mark on this one. That quote from Jobs was very specific. It came at a time when Apple was <em>not</em> making great products, and when Apple&#8217;s fans and perhaps even employees were locked into a mindset that the wrong platform &#8212; Windows &#8212; had won. That Windows&#8217;s almost unimaginable success, its spectacular rise to worldwide ubiquity, was an injustice &#8212; one that only Apple could right. He wasn&#8217;t claiming that for Apple to succeed <em>no one</em> had to lose, only Microsoft (and, really, Windows in particular &#8212; as opposed to then-future initiatives like MP3 players and mobile phones, where for Apple to succeed it certainly helped that Microsoft lost).</p><p>Note too that Jobs&#8217;s message was bitter medicine. He was surrendering a war that the audience wanted Apple to continue fighting. As Jason Breitkopf noted in a comment on Betteridge&#8217;s piece, Jobs was booed, resoundingly,<sup id="fnr1-2013-05-16"><a href="#fn1-2013-05-16">1</a></sup> by the Macworld audience several times during his announcement. Page&#8217;s message at I/O was greeted with applause. Page was telling the I/O audience what they wanted to hear, that Google is something other than a ruthless, greedy competitor.</p><p>I&#8217;m not arguing that Apple is not also a ruthless and greedy competitor. In fact, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2013/05/google_versus">my piece yesterday</a> had nothing to do with Apple &#8212; only Google. (I should have left Android and the iPhone out of it, as that was the only oblique reference to Apple.) The difference is that Apple hasn&#8217;t claimed otherwise. Again, Jobs wasn&#8217;t claiming in 1997 that <em>no one</em> had to lose for Apple to win. The drum I&#8217;m trying to bang here is not that Google is a greedy competitor, but rather that Google is a greedy competitor that presents itself as anything but &#8212; as a sort of peaceful, whimsical, happy-go-lucky techno-futurist corporate utopian &#8212; and that rather than see this pose as absurd, many people, Googlers and Google users alike, buy it.</p><p>All organizations have aspirations. You&#8217;re welcome to roll your eyes at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZeOhnTuq2I">Steve Jobs&#8217;s spiel about Apple existing at the intersection of technology and the liberal arts</a>, or <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-07/30/jonathan-ive-revenue-good-design">this from Jony Ive</a>:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;We are really pleased with our revenues but our goal isn&#8217;t to
                make money. It sounds a little flippant, but it&#8217;s the truth. Our
                goal and what makes us excited is to make great products. If we
                are successful people will like them and if we are operationally
                competent, we will make money,&#8221; he said.</p></blockquote><p>Mere spin? Perhaps. But those statements from Jobs and Ive are not absurd. If they&#8217;re not the absolute truth, they&#8217;re at least truthy. Whereas Larry Page&#8217;s pablum regarding Google not being pitted against other companies is farcical. <a href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/lpt/a/2387">Tim O&#8217;Reilly had a good line about Microsoft</a> a decade ago:</p><blockquote><p>Microsoft gets a lot of heat for not leaving enough on the table
                for others. My mother, who&#8217;s English, and quite a character, once
                said of Bill Gates, &#8220;He sounds like someone who would come to your
                house for dinner and say, &#8216;Thank you. I think I&#8217;ll have all the
                mashed potatoes.&#8217;&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>That&#8217;s Google today. What major tech giant has Google <em>not</em> pitted itself against? Whose mashed potatoes <a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2013/03/google-slips-accidentally-unveils-evernote-like-google-keep-service/">do they not seek to take</a>? Apple, Microsoft, Yahoo, Oracle, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon &#8212; Google has made enemies of all of them. The difference between Google&#8217;s predatory rapaciousness today and Microsoft&#8217;s of yore is that Microsoft wore it on their sleeve, they owned it, celebrated it.</p><p>What rankles about Google is their hypocrisy.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2013-05-16"><p>Seriously, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxOp5mBY9IY">watch the video</a>. E.g., around the 2:30 mark, when Jobs announces that Internet Explorer will be the new default browser for Mac OS. The audience is outraged.

                <p>Larry Page, <a href="http://thenextweb.com/google/2013/05/15/google-glass/">on stage at I/O today</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Every story I read about Google is &#8220;us versus some other company&#8221;
                or some stupid thing, and I just don’t find that very interesting.
                We should be building great things that don’t exist. Being
                negative isn’t how we make progress. Most important things are not
                zero sum, there is a lot of opportunity out there.</p></blockquote><p>Google fans seem to eat this kumbaya stuff up, to really believe it. But Google is the company that built Android after the iPhone, Google Plus after Facebook, and now a subscription music service after Spotify. They entered the RSS reader market, wiped it out, and are now just walking away from it. Gmail? Webmail but better. Think about even web search: Google search wasn&#8217;t something new; it was something better. Way, way, way better, but still. </p><p>Consider maps. Google Maps entered a market where MapQuest and others had been around for years. That wasn&#8217;t something great that didn&#8217;t already exist. It was a better version of something that already existed. Google is a hyper-competitive company, and they repeatedly enter markets that already exist and crush competitors. Nothing wrong with that. That&#8217;s how capitalism is supposed to work, and Google&#8217;s successes are admirable. But there&#8217;s nothing stupid about seeing Google being pitted &#8220;versus&#8221; other companies. They want everything; their ambition is boundless.</p>

                <p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/05/12/droidfooding-home/">Josh Constine, writing for AOL/TechCrunch</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Facebook didn’t realize just how important widgets, docks, and app
                folders were to Android users, and that leaving them out of Home
                was a huge mistake. That’s because some of the Facebookers who
                built and tested Home normally carry iPhones, I’ve confirmed. Lack
                of “droidfooding” has left Facebook scrambling to add these
                features, whose absence have led Home to just 1 million downloads
                since launching a month ago. […]</p><p>The lack of droidfooders didn’t have serious consequences until
                Home, Facebook’s new “apperating system”. It replaces the lock
                screen, homescreen, and app launcher of compatible Android phones
                with a Facebook-centric experience. It offers Cover Feed, a big,
                beautiful way to browser the news feed the second you bring your
                phone out of sleep. It’s missing the ability to build real-time
                information widgets, put your most used apps in a persistently
                visible dock, or organize your collection of apps into folders.</p></blockquote><p>Constine is jumping to some unsupported conclusions here. Is it possible that Facebook Home has fallen flat on Android because it was designed by iPhone users? That&#8217;s certainly possible. But more likely, it seems to me, is that Facebook Home is just a bad idea. As I said <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/05/10/facebook-flop">last week</a>, it&#8217;s a well-designed implementation of an idea no one wants. Would iPhone users want this? I can&#8217;t see why. And if the problem is that Facebook Home designers are iPhone users, it might explain why they didn&#8217;t see the appeal of widgets, but how would it explain the lack of a persistent app dock or app folders? The iPhone has those. I suspect most iPhone users would miss them if they were able to install Facebook Home.</p><p>Facebook Home isn&#8217;t an iPhone idea. It&#8217;s just a bad idea. <a href="http://stratechery.com/2013/facebook-phones-and-the-future-of-mobile-communication/">Facebook is an app, not a platform.</a> A good home screen interface is one that accommodates any app or service, not just one.</p><p>There is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food">dogfooding</a> lesson here, though. Does Mark Zuckerberg carry an HTC First, or any other Android phone with Facebook Home installed? Does Mike Matas? (Doesn&#8217;t look like it, judging by the &#8220;via Twitter for iPhone&#8221; metadata on his <a href="https://twitter.com/mike_matas/status/324186555390513154">recent</a><a href="https://twitter.com/mike_matas/status/327681441796325376">tweets</a>.) Why not?</p><p>It&#8217;s always a sign of trouble when you&#8217;ve built something you don&#8217;t want to use yourself. Why does everyone I know who works at Apple carry an iPhone? Every single one? Not because they have to. It&#8217;s because they <em>want</em> to.</p><p>Turn Facebook Home into an interface that Facebook designers and engineers <em>want</em> to use, not merely feel obligated to use, and then they&#8217;ll have something. But if it remains something that even Facebook&#8217;s own designers and engineers do not prefer over the iPhone (or stock Android, or any other platform), if it remains something that the company needs propaganda posters to promote even among its own employees, then Facebook Home will remain what it is now. A dud.</p>
