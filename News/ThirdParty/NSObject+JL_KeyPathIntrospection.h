/** 
 Implements methods to simplify Objective-C runtime introspection on key paths.
 
 JL_KeyPathIntrospection is cool because instead of traveling a particular instance
 like `valueForKeyPath:` and related methods do, this category traverses the class
 definitions themselves.
 
 Useful for adding to your own frameworks when you want to take arbitrary objects
 with various data-types and key paths from framework consumers. 
 
 For example, JL_KeyPathIntrospection is useful for taking an object and then a 
 property list configuration file with key paths and various other pieces of 
 metadata and then processing the data or generating UI. I have personally used 
 this category to write a small framework that takes an arbitrary object and an 
 HTML template that contains marked-up keypaths and generates a PDF. It uses key 
 path introspection to smartly determine how to handle types like dates and 
 collections. I've also used it in another framework that took a property list of 
 keypaths and metadata and an object and created table views with different cell 
 input views depending on the keypath data type which then automatically retrieved 
 and saved properties on the passed-in object.
 
 ## Notes
 
 `id` is simply a typedef for a struct; It is not a full-fledged class.
 Therefore when checking for type `id`, use the primitive introspection methods
 which will return `@` for properties declared as type `id`.
 
 ## Warnings
 
 Because the introspection is done on the class definition and not a particular
 instance, introspection will dead-end when the property is of type id. It will 
 also report the declared object type, so for example if you externally declare
 a property of type `NSArray` but internally you return an `NSMutableArray`, 
 property introspection will report it as an NSArray. Should I add a keyword like
 @runtimeType or something or a totally separate implementation? What's most
 useful and efficient? I should check libextobjc and see if they do something
 similar.
 
 JL_KeyPathIntrospection does not look at private property (re)declarations.
