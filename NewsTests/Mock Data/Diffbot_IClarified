Recent concerns about the illegal mining of tin from this region prompted Apple to lead a fact-finding visit to learn more.

About 190K order came from its website after originally selling around 85k via Kickstarter.\\nSmartwatch startup Pebble revealed today for the first time that it has received 190,000 pre-orders for its wearable computing accessory through its own web store following the tremendously successful Kickstarter campaign it ran last year. That means it amassed around 275,000 pre-orders total for the smartwatch, which is impressive early traction for a device that didn\\u2019t have a proven market in place to sell into.\\nPebble also announced they have hired 29 employees and plan on hiring more. Additionally, in 2-3 weeks support for email notifications will be rolled out.\\nA major new feature on iOS will be available within 2-3 weeks. The feature has been lacking since launch: support for email notifications.

Estimates peg Apple at a 22 percent decline in net income in the third quarter. <\\\/p><p>However, Moffett believes Apple may simply ignore these commitments since other carriers around the world are in similar situations.<\\\/p><p><i>It is likely that Apple would be reluctant to simply ignore these commitments, since many other carriers around the world are probably in a similar situation, and a simple amnesty would set an unwanted precedent,&rdquo; Moffett wrote. &ldquo;It is therefore unrealistic to think that Apple won&rsquo;t extract some consideration for renegotiating these shortfalls.&rdquo;<\\\/i><\\\/p><p>Both Apple and Verizon declined to comment.<\\\/p><p><a href=\\\"http:\\\/\\\/www.bloomberg.com\\\/news\\\/2013-07-10\\\/verizon-seen-owing-apple-up-to-14-billion-for-iphones.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Read More<\\\/a> via <a href=\\\"http:\\\/\\\/www.macrumors.com\\\/2013\\\/07\\\/11\\\/verizon-could-face-up-to-14-billion-in-unsold-iphone-purchase-commitments-for-2013\\\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">MacRumors<\\\/a><\\\/p><p><a data-lightview-group=\\\"iclarified\\\" data-lightview-options=\\\"skin: 'mac'\\\" href=\\\"http:\\\/\\\/www.iClarified.com\\\/entry\\\/lightview.php?location=\\\/images\\\/news\\\/31855\\\/130273\\\/130273-1280.jpg\\\"><img alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" height=\\\"640\\\" src=\\\"http:\\\/\\\/www.iClarified.com\\\/images\\\/news\\\/31855\\\/130273\\\/130273-1280.jpg\\\" width=\\\"640\\\"><\\\/img><\\\/a><br><\\\/br><\\\/p><\\\/div><div id=\\\"share_bottom\\\"><strong>Share<\\\/strong><div id=\\\"article_share_bottom\\\"><div><\\\/div><div><a href=\\\"http:\\\/\\\/www.iClarified.com\\\/entry\\\/email.php?enid=31855\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><img border=\\\"0\\\" height=\\\"21\\\" src=\\\"http:\\\/\\\/www.iClarified.com\\\/images\\\/icons\\\/email-32.png\\\"><\\\/img><\\\/a><\\\/div><div><a href=\\\"http:\\\/\\\/digg.com\\\/submit?phase=2&url=http:\\\/\\\/www.iclarified.com\\\/31855\\\/verizon-could-owe-apple-up-to-14-billion-in-unsold-iphones&title=Verizon Could Owe Apple Up To $14 Billion In Unsold iPhones&bodytext=Verizon could face a huge bill of up to $14 billion from Apple for Unsold iPhones&topic=apple\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><img border=\\\"0\\\" height=\\\"21\\\" src=\\\"http:\\\/\\\/www.iClarified.com\\\/images\\\/icons\\\/digg-32.png\\\"><\\\/img><\\\/a><\\\/div><div><a href=\\\"http:\\\/\\\/www.reddit.com\\\/submit?url=http:\\\/\\\/www.iClarified.com\\\/31855&title=Verizon Could Owe Apple Up To $14 Billion In Unsold iPhones\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><img border=\\\"0\\\" height=\\\"21\\\" src=\\\"http:\\\/\\\/www.iClarified.com\\\/images\\\/icons\\\/reddit-32.png\\\"><\\\/img><\\\/a><\\\/div><div><a href=\\\"http:\\\/\\\/www.stumbleupon.com\\\/submit?url=http:\\\/\\\/www.iclarified.com\\\/31855\\\/verizon-could-owe-apple-up-to-14-billion-in-unsold-iphones&title=Verizon Could Owe Apple Up To $14 Billion In Unsold iPhones\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><img border=\\\"0\\\" height=\\\"21\\\" src=\\\"http:\\\/\\\/www.iClarified.com\\\/images\\\/icons\\\/stumbleupon-32.png\\\"><\\\/img><\\\/a><\\\/div><div><a href=\\\"http:\\\/\\\/del.icio.us\\\/post\\\" onclick=\\\"window.open('http:\\\/\\\/del.icio.us\\\/post?v=4&noui&jump=close&url='+encodeURIComponent(location.href)+'&title='+encodeURIComponent(document.title), 'delicious','toolbar=no,width=700,height=400'); return false;\\\"><img border=\\\"0\\\" height=\\\"21\\\" src=\\\"http:\\\/\\\/www.iClarified.com\\\/images\\\/icons\\\/delicious-32.png\\\"><\\\/img><\\\/a><\\\/div><\\\/div><\\\/div><\\\/div>\",\"type\":\"article\",\"media\":[{\"link\":\"http:\\\/\\\/www.iClarified.com\\\/images\\\/news\\\/31855\\\/130273\\\/130273-1280.jpg\",\"primary\":\"true\",\"type\":\"image\"}],\"url\":\"http:\\\/\\\/www.iClarified.com\\\/31855\\\/verizon-could-owe-apple-up-to-14-billion-in-unsold-iphones\",\"xpath\":\"\\\/HTML[1]\\\/BODY[1]\\\/DIV[3]\\\/DIV[3]\\\/DIV[1]\"}\n","code":200},{"headers":[{"name":null,"value":"HTTP\/1.1 200 OK"},{"name":"Transfer-Encoding","value":"chunked"},{"name":"Vary","value":"Accept-Encoding"},{"name":"Date","value":"Fri, 12 Jul 2013 03:54:12 GMT"},{"name":"Content-Type","value":"application\/json;charset=UTF-8"},{"name":"Server","value":"Apache-Coyote\/1.1"}],"body":"{\"summary\":\"Posted 12 hours ago by iClarified | Please help us and submit a translation by clicking here | 3336 views.

The lesser we desire, the lesser we suffer. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<\\\/p><\\\/div><\\\/div><div id=\\\"comment_204040\\\"><img src=\\\"http:\\\/\\\/www.iClarified.com\\\/images\\\/users\\\/0-grey.png\\\" width=\\\"47\\\"><\\\/img><div><p><strong>Mr. Mister<\\\/strong><font> - 10 hours ago<\\\/font><\\\/p><p>Agreed!

In the earliest days, it was by putting a PC on every desk and in every home. We\\u2019ve come farther than we could have imagined. The impact we have collectively made on the world is undeniable, and I am inspired when talented new hires say they chose Microsoft because they want to change the world \\u2014 that\\u2019s what we do today, and that\\u2019s what we\\u2019ll do tomorrow.\\nSharpening Our Strategy\\nAbout a year ago, we embarked on a new strategy to realize our vision, opening the devices and services chapter for Microsoft. We made important strides \\u2014 launching Windows 8 and Surface, moving to continuous product cycles, bringing a consistent user interface to PCs, tablets, phones and Xbox \\u2014 but we have much more to do.\\nGoing forward, our strategy will focus on creating a family of devices and services for individuals and businesses that empower people around the globe at home, at work and on the go, for the activities they value most.\\nWe will do this by leveraging our strengths. We have powered devices for many years through Windows PCs and Xbox. We have delivered high-value experiences through Office and other apps. And, we have enabled enterprise value through products like Windows Server and Exchange. The form of delivery shifts to a broader set of devices and services versus packaged software. The frontier of high-value scenarios we enable will march outward, but we have strengths and proven capabilities on which we will draw.\\nThis memo shows you how far we have developed our thinking on our strategy for high- value activities based on devices and services delivery.\\nDriving Our Success\\nIt is also clear to me and our leadership that we must do an extraordinary job to succeed in this modern world. We have delivered many great products and had much success in market, but we all want more. That means better execution from product conceptualization and innovation right through to marketing and sales. It also means operational excellence in cloud services, datacenter operations, and manufacturing and supply chain that are essential in a devices and services world. To advance our strategy and execute more quickly, more efficiently, and with greater excellence we need to transform how we organize, how we plan and how we work.\\nImproving our performance has three big dimensions: focusing the whole company on a single strategy, improving our capability in all disciplines and engineering\\\/technology areas, and working together with more collaboration and agility around our common goals.\\nThis is a big undertaking. It touches nearly every piece of what we do and how we work. It changes our org structure, the way we collaborate, how we allocate resources, how we best empower our engineers and how we market.\\nOne Strategy, One Microsoft\\nWe are rallying behind a single strategy as one company \\u2014 not a collection of divisional strategies. Although we will deliver multiple devices and services to execute and monetize the strategy, the single core strategy will drive us to set shared goals for everything we do. We will see our product line holistically, not as a set of islands. We will allocate resources and build devices and services that provide compelling, integrated experiences across the many screens in our lives, with maximum return to shareholders. All parts of the company will share and contribute to the success of core offerings, like Windows, Windows Phone, Xbox, Surface, Office 365 and our EA offer, Bing, Skype, Dynamics, Azure and our servers. All parts of the company will contribute to activating high-value experiences for our customers.\\nWe will reshape how we interact with our customers, developers and key innovation partners, delivering a more coherent message and family of product offerings. The evangelism and business development team will drive partners across our integrated strategy and its execution. Our marketing, advertising and all our customer interaction will be designed to reflect one company with integrated approaches to our consumer and business marketplaces.\\nHow we organize our engineering efforts will also change to reflect this strategy. We will pull together disparate engineering efforts today into a coherent set of our high-value activities. This will enable us to deliver the most capability \\u2014 and be most efficient in development and operations \\u2014 with the greatest coherence to all our key customers. We will plan across the company, so we can better deliver compelling integrated devices and services for the high-value experiences and core technologies around which we organize. This new planning approach will look at both the short-term deliverables and long-term initiatives needed to meet the shipment cadences of both Microsoft and third-party devices and our services.\\nThis means we will organize the company by function: Engineering (including supply chain and datacenters), Marketing, Business Development and Evangelism, Advanced Strategy and Research, Finance, HR, Legal, and COO (including field, support, commercial operations and IT). Each discipline will help drive our overall strategy. Each discipline will also be charged with improving our core capabilities in its area. We must improve in all aspects of the business.\\nThere will be four engineering areas: OS, Apps, Cloud, and Devices. We will keep Dynamics separate as it continues to need special focus and represents significant opportunity. We will consolidate our technologies coherently into these groups pulling together some things that have been spread out in our current BG structure like cloud infrastructure, operating systems, mail, and identity, to name a few. Some of these changes will involve putting things together and others will involve repartitioning the work, but in all instances we will be more coherent for our users and developers. We have resolved many details of this org, but we still will have more work to do. Undoubtedly, as we involve more people there will be new issues and changes to our current thinking as well. Completing this process will take through the end of the calendar year as we figure things out and as we keep existing teams focused on current deliverables like Windows 8.1, Xbox One, Windows Phone, etc.\\nTo improve engineering pace and quality, we will increase focus on our engineering systems, processes, and tools to improve the productivity of every engineer and to facilitate engineering collaboration and contribution across the company. Our engineering culture and new structure will enable more cross- group contribution, while maintaining confidentiality of some projects as needed. We will improve the approach we use to get MSR involved in product development, building on and enhancing our significant strengths there.\\nOrganizing for Speed and Strategic Alignment\\nSpecifically, our teams and their leaders will be these:\\n● Operating Systems Engineering Group. Terry Myerson will lead this group, and it will span all our OS work for console, to mobile device, to PC, to back-end systems. The core cloud services for the operating system will be in this group.\\n● Devices and Studios Engineering Group. Julie Larson-Green will lead this group and will have all hardware development and supply chain from the smallest to the largest devices we build. Julie will also take responsibility for our studios experiences including all games, music, video and other entertainment.\\n● Applications and Services Engineering Group. Qi Lu will lead broad applications and services core technologies in productivity, communication, search and other information categories.\\n● Cloud and Enterprise Engineering Group. Satya Nadella will lead development of our back-end technologies like datacenter, database and our specific technologies for enterprise IT scenarios and development tools. He will lead datacenter development, construction and operation.\\n● Dynamics. Kirill Tatarinov will continue to run Dynamics as is, but his product leaders will dotted line report to Qi Lu, his marketing leader will dotted line report to Tami Reller and his sales leader will dotted line report to the COO group.\\n● Advanced Strategy and Research Group. Eric Rudder will lead Research, Trustworthy Computing, teams focused on the intersection of technology and policy, and will drive our cross-company looks at key new technology trends.\\n● Marketing Group. Tami Reller will lead all marketing with the field relationship as is today. Mark Penn will take a broad view of marketing strategy and will lead with Tami the newly centralized advertising and media functions.\\n● COO. Kevin Turner will continue leading our worldwide sales, field marketing, services, support, and stores as well as IT, licensing and commercial operations.\\n● Business Development and Evangelism Group. Tony Bates will focus on key partnerships especially our innovation partners (OEMs, silicon vendors, key developers, Yahoo, Nokia, etc.) and our broad work on evangelism and developer outreach. DPE, Corporate Strategy and the business development efforts formerly in the BGs will become part of this new group. OEM will remain in SMSG with Kevin Turner with a dotted line to Tony who will work closely with Nick Parker on key OEM relationships.\\n● Finance Group. Amy Hood will centralize all product group finance organizations. SMSG finance, which is geographically diffuse, will report to Kevin Turner with a dotted line to Amy.\\n● Legal and Corporate Affairs Group. Brad Smith will continue as General Counsel with responsibility for the company's legal and corporate affairs and will map his team to the new organization.\\n● HR Group. Lisa Brummel will lead Human Resources and map her team to the new organization.\\nAs part of these changes, Kurt DelBene will be retiring from Microsoft. Kurt has been a huge part of our success in evolving Office to be a great cloud service, and is a key member of my leadership team. I can\\u2019t express enough gratitude for the work he\\u2019s done for the company, and I will truly miss him. Kurt is a truly amazing leader and a special person. His contributions to Microsoft over 20+ years can inspire us all.\\nCraig Mundie will be stepping off the SLT to devote 100% of his time to a special project for me through the end of this calendar year. Beginning in 2014, Craig will continue as a consultant through his previously agreed upon departure date at the end of calendar 2014.\\nAlso at this time, Rick Rashid will step away from running Microsoft Research and move into a new role driving core OS innovation in our operating systems group. Rick created MSR, the most amazing computer science research institution in the world. We owe him so much for that. He has a great team to assume the mantle, and it is exciting to have Rick return to his roots in OS to help propel us forward.\\nHow We Work\\nThe final piece of the puzzle is how we work together and what characteristics this new Microsoft must embody. There is a process element and a culture element to discuss.\\nProcess wise, each major initiative of the company (product or high-value scenario) will have a team that spans groups to ensure we succeed against our goals. Our strategy will drive what initiatives we agree and commit to at my staff meetings. Most disciplines and product groups will have a core that delivers key technology or services and then a piece that lines up with the initiatives. Each major initiative will have a champion who will be a direct report to me or one of my direct reports. The champion will organize to drive a cross-company team for success, but my whole staff will have commitment to the initiative\\u2019s success. We will also have outgrowths on those major initiatives that may involve only a single product group. Certainly, succeeding with mobile devices, Windows, Office 365 and Azure will be foundational. Xbox and Bing will also be key future contributors to financial success. Our focus on high-value activities \\u2014 serious fun, meetings, tasks, research, information assurance and IT\\\/Dev workloads \\u2014 also will get top-level championship.\\nCulturally, our core values don\\u2019t change, but how we express them and act day to day must evolve so we work together to win. The keys are the following:\\nNimble\\nIn a world of continuous services, the timeframe for product releases, customer interaction and competitive response is dramatically shorter. As a company, we need to make the right decisions, and make them more quickly, balancing all the customer and business imperatives. Each employee must be able to solve problems more quickly and with more real-time data than in the past.\\nCommunicative\\nIn the new, rapid-turn world, we need to communicate in ways that don\\u2019t just exchange information but drive agility, action, ownership and accountability.\\nCollaborative\\nCollaborative doesn\\u2019t just mean \\u201Ceasy to get along with.\\u201D Collaboration means the ability to coordinate effectively, within and among teams, to get results, build better products faster, and drive customer and shareholder value.\\nDecisive\\nAs a global company with literally billions of diverse customers in an accelerating business environment, we must have a clear strategic direction but also empower employees closest to the customer to make decisions in service of the larger mission. This is tricky in a big company, but it is the key to higher levels of productivity, growth and customer satisfaction.\\nMotivated\\nIn our industry, every day brings more challenges and more opportunities than the day before. But we have a unique chance to make the lives of billions of people better in fundamental ways. This should inspire all of us \\u2014 those who love making products and services, those who love engaging with customers, and those who love planning and running our company in the most effective way possible. We want people who get up each morning excited to make Microsoft better \\u2014 that\\u2019s how we come closer to fulfilling the potential of all people around the globe.\\nOur leadership team has discussed these cultural aspects a lot and is committed. In my own staff meetings, we are modeling these new characteristics yet also find ourselves occasionally slipping back. One strategy, united together, with great communication, decisiveness and positive energy is the only way to fly.\\nSeizing Our Unique Opportunity\\nTogether, we have created great products and great success, but we all want more. That means a strategy to deliver a family of devices and services that best enable people for the activities they value most and the enterprise extensions and services that are most valuable to business. A new structure to bring these to market faster. Stronger centralized services so we can be more efficient and effective. Priority focus areas, short and long term. New characteristics of how we work together. In other words, better execution and innovation through strategy and goal and discipline and engineering coherence. One Microsoft all the time.\\nAcross Microsoft, we are facing incredible new opportunities. As devices become further integrated into everyday life, we will have to create new and extraordinary experiences for our customers on these devices. We are going to focus on completely reinventing experiences like creating or viewing a creative document and what it means to communicate socially at home or in meetings at work. We are going to immerse people in deep entertainment experiences that let them have serious fun in ways so intense and delightful that they will blur the line between reality and fantasy. And as we develop these new experiences, we will also support our developers with the simplest ways to develop apps or cloud services and integrate with our products. We will help businesses that find themselves in a new world of ever-mounting information to manage that information through greater enterprise information assurance. We will make these high-value activities priorities in our strategy.\\nLots of change. But in all of this, many key things remains the same. Our incredible people, our spirit, our commitment, our belief in the transformative power of technology \\u2014 our Microsoft technology \\u2014 to make the world a better place for billions of people and millions of businesses around the world. It\\u2019s why I come to work inspired every day. It\\u2019s why we\\u2019ve evolved before, and why we\\u2019re evolving now. Because we\\u2019re not done.\\nLet\\u2019s go.\\nSteve\\n-----\",\"title\":\"Steve Ballmer Announces 'One Microsoft' Company Realignment\",\"html\":\"<div id=\\\"article_body\\\"><p>Microsoft Steve Ballmer has sent an internal email to employees regarding major changes in the senior leadership team at the company.<\\\/p><p>\\\"We are rallying behind a single strategy as one company &mdash; not a collection of divisional strategies. Although we will deliver multiple devices and services to execute and monetize the strategy, the single core strategy will drive us to set shared goals for everything we do. We will see our product line holistically, not as a set of islands. We will allocate resources and build devices and services that provide compelling, integrated experiences across the many screens in our lives, with maximum return to shareholders. All parts of the company will share and contribute to the success of core offerings, like Windows, Windows Phone, Xbox, Surface, Office 365 and our EA offer, Bing, Skype, Dynamics, Azure and our servers. All parts of the company will contribute to activating high-value experiences for our customers.\\\"<\\\/p><p>Here is his email in full:<\\\/p><p>-----<br><\\\/br>From: Steve Ballmer<br><\\\/br>To: Microsoft - All Employees<br><\\\/br>Date: July 11, 2013, 6 a.m.<br><\\\/br>Subject: One Microsoft<\\\/p><p>Today, we are announcing a far-reaching realignment of the company that will enable us to innovate with greater speed, efficiency and capability in a fast changing world.<\\\/p><p>Today&rsquo;s announcement will enable us to execute even better on our strategy to deliver a family of devices and services that best empower people for the activities they value most and the enterprise extensions and services that are most valuable to business.<\\\/p><p>This company has always had a big vision &mdash; to help people realize their full potential. In the earliest days, it was by putting a PC on every desk and in every home. We&rsquo;ve come farther than we could have imagined. The impact we have collectively made on the world is undeniable, and I am inspired when talented new hires say they chose Microsoft because they want to change the world &mdash; that&rsquo;s what we do today, and that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll do tomorrow.<\\\/p><p><b>Sharpening Our Strategy<\\\/b><br><\\\/br>About a year ago, we embarked on a new strategy to realize our vision, opening the devices and services chapter for Microsoft. We made important strides &mdash; launching Windows 8 and Surface, moving to continuous product cycles, bringing a consistent user interface to PCs, tablets, phones and Xbox &mdash; but we have much more to do.<\\\/p><p>Going forward, our strategy will focus on creating a family of devices and services for individuals and businesses that empower people around the globe at home, at work and on the go, for the activities they value most.<\\\/p><p>We will do this by leveraging our strengths. We have powered devices for many years through Windows PCs and Xbox. We have delivered high-value experiences through Office and other apps. And, we have enabled enterprise value through products like Windows Server and Exchange. The form of delivery shifts to a broader set of devices and services versus packaged software. The frontier of high-value scenarios we enable will march outward, but we have strengths and proven capabilities on which we will draw.<\\\/p><p>This memo shows you how far we have developed our thinking on our strategy for high- value activities based on devices and services delivery.<\\\/p><p><b>Driving Our Success<\\\/b><br><\\\/br>It is also clear to me and our leadership that we must do an extraordinary job to succeed in this modern world. We have delivered many great products and had much success in market, but we all want more. That means better execution from product conceptualization and innovation right through to marketing and sales. It also means operational excellence in cloud services, datacenter operations, and manufacturing and supply chain that are essential in a devices and services world. To advance our strategy and execute more quickly, more efficiently, and with greater excellence we need to transform how we organize, how we plan and how we work.<\\\/p><p>Improving our performance has three big dimensions: focusing the whole company on a single strategy, improving our capability in all disciplines and engineering\\\/technology areas, and working together with more collaboration and agility around our common goals.<\\\/p><p>This is a big undertaking. It touches nearly every piece of what we do and how we work. It changes our org structure, the way we collaborate, how we allocate resources, how we best empower our engineers and how we market.<\\\/p><p><b>One Strategy, One Microsoft<\\\/b><br><\\\/br>We are rallying behind a single strategy as one company &mdash; not a collection of divisional strategies. Although we will deliver multiple devices and services to execute and monetize the strategy, the single core strategy will drive us to set shared goals for everything we do. We will see our product line holistically, not as a set of islands. We will allocate resources and build devices and services that provide compelling, integrated experiences across the many screens in our lives, with maximum return to shareholders. All parts of the company will share and contribute to the success of core offerings, like Windows, Windows Phone, Xbox, Surface, Office 365 and our EA offer, Bing, Skype, Dynamics, Azure and our servers. All parts of the company will contribute to activating high-value experiences for our customers.<\\\/p><p>We will reshape how we interact with our customers, developers and key innovation partners, delivering a more coherent message and family of product offerings. The evangelism and business development team will drive partners across our integrated strategy and its execution. Our marketing, advertising and all our customer interaction will be designed to reflect one company with integrated approaches to our consumer and business marketplaces.<\\\/p><p>How we organize our engineering efforts will also change to reflect this strategy. We will pull together disparate engineering efforts today into a coherent set of our high-value activities. This will enable us to deliver the most capability &mdash; and be most efficient in development and operations &mdash; with the greatest coherence to all our key customers. We will plan across the company, so we can better deliver compelling integrated devices and services for the high-value experiences and core technologies around which we organize. This new planning approach will look at both the short-term deliverables and long-term initiatives needed to meet the shipment cadences of both Microsoft and third-party devices and our services.<\\\/p><p>This means we will organize the company by function: Engineering (including supply chain and datacenters), Marketing, Business Development and Evangelism, Advanced Strategy and Research, Finance, HR, Legal, and COO (including field, support, commercial operations and IT). Each discipline will help drive our overall strategy. Each discipline will also be charged with improving our core capabilities in its area. We must improve in all aspects of the business.<\\\/p><p>There will be four engineering areas: OS, Apps, Cloud, and Devices. We will keep Dynamics separate as it continues to need special focus and represents significant opportunity. We will consolidate our technologies coherently into these groups pulling together some things that have been spread out in our current BG structure like cloud infrastructure, operating systems, mail, and identity, to name a few. Some of these changes will involve putting things together and others will involve repartitioning the work, but in all instances we will be more coherent for our users and developers. We have resolved many details of this org, but we still will have more work to do. Undoubtedly, as we involve more people there will be new issues and changes to our current thinking as well. Completing this process will take through the end of the calendar year as we figure things out and as we keep existing teams focused on current deliverables like Windows 8.1, Xbox One, Windows Phone, etc.<\\\/p><p>To improve engineering pace and quality, we will increase focus on our engineering systems, processes, and tools to improve the productivity of every engineer and to facilitate engineering collaboration and contribution across the company. Our engineering culture and new structure will enable more cross- group contribution, while maintaining confidentiality of some projects as needed. We will improve the approach we use to get MSR involved in product development, building on and enhancing our significant strengths there.<\\\/p><p><b>Organizing for Speed and Strategic Alignment<\\\/b><br><\\\/br>Specifically, our teams and their leaders will be these:<\\\/p><p>● Operating Systems Engineering Group. Terry Myerson will lead this group, and it will span all our OS work for console, to mobile device, to PC, to back-end systems. The core cloud services for the operating system will be in this group.<\\\/p><p>● Devices and Studios Engineering Group. Julie Larson-Green will lead this group and will have all hardware development and supply chain from the smallest to the largest devices we build. Julie will also take responsibility for our studios experiences including all games, music, video and other entertainment.<\\\/p><p>● Applications and Services Engineering Group. Qi Lu will lead broad applications and services core technologies in productivity, communication, search and other information categories.<\\\/p><p>● Cloud and Enterprise Engineering Group. Satya Nadella will lead development of our back-end technologies like datacenter, database and our specific technologies for enterprise IT scenarios and development tools. He will lead datacenter development, construction and operation.<\\\/p><p>● Dynamics. Kirill Tatarinov will continue to run Dynamics as is, but his product leaders will dotted line report to Qi Lu, his marketing leader will dotted line report to Tami Reller and his sales leader will dotted line report to the COO group.<\\\/p><p>● Advanced Strategy and Research Group. Eric Rudder will lead Research, Trustworthy Computing, teams focused on the intersection of technology and policy, and will drive our cross-company looks at key new technology trends.<\\\/p><p>● Marketing Group. Tami Reller will lead all marketing with the field relationship as is today. Mark Penn will take a broad view of marketing strategy and will lead with Tami the newly centralized advertising and media functions.<\\\/p><p>● COO. Kevin Turner will continue leading our worldwide sales, field marketing, services, support, and stores as well as IT, licensing and commercial operations.<\\\/p><p>● Business Development and Evangelism Group. Tony Bates will focus on key partnerships especially our innovation partners (OEMs, silicon vendors, key developers, Yahoo, Nokia, etc.) and our broad work on evangelism and developer outreach. DPE, Corporate Strategy and the business development efforts formerly in the BGs will become part of this new group. OEM will remain in SMSG with Kevin Turner with a dotted line to Tony who will work closely with Nick Parker on key OEM relationships.<\\\/p><p>● Finance Group. Amy Hood will centralize all product group finance organizations. SMSG finance, which is geographically diffuse, will report to Kevin Turner with a dotted line to Amy.<\\\/p><p>● Legal and Corporate Affairs Group. Brad Smith will continue as General Counsel with responsibility for the company's legal and corporate affairs and will map his team to the new organization.<\\\/p><p>● HR Group. Lisa Brummel will lead Human Resources and map her team to the new organization. <\\\/p><p>As part of these changes, Kurt DelBene will be retiring from Microsoft. Kurt has been a huge part of our success in evolving Office to be a great cloud service, and is a key member of my leadership team. I can&rsquo;t express enough gratitude for the work he&rsquo;s done for the company, and I will truly miss him. Kurt is a truly amazing leader and a special person. His contributions to Microsoft over 20+ years can inspire us all.<\\\/p><p>Craig Mundie will be stepping off the SLT to devote 100% of his time to a special project for me through the end of this calendar year. Beginning in 2014, Craig will continue as a consultant through his previously agreed upon departure date at the end of calendar 2014.<\\\/p><p>Also at this time, Rick Rashid will step away from running Microsoft Research and move into a new role driving core OS innovation in our operating systems group. Rick created MSR, the most amazing computer science research institution in the world. We owe him so much for that. He has a great team to assume the mantle, and it is exciting to have Rick return to his roots in OS to help propel us forward.<\\\/p><p><b>How We Work<\\\/b><br><\\\/br>The final piece of the puzzle is how we work together and what characteristics this new Microsoft must embody. There is a process element and a culture element to discuss.<\\\/p><p>Process wise, each major initiative of the company (product or high-value scenario) will have a team that spans groups to ensure we succeed against our goals. Our strategy will drive what initiatives we agree and commit to at my staff meetings. Most disciplines and product groups will have a core that delivers key technology or services and then a piece that lines up with the initiatives. Each major initiative will have a champion who will be a direct report to me or one of my direct reports. The champion will organize to drive a cross-company team for success, but my whole staff will have commitment to the initiative&rsquo;s success. We will also have outgrowths on those major initiatives that may involve only a single product group. Certainly, succeeding with mobile devices, Windows, Office 365 and Azure will be foundational. Xbox and Bing will also be key future contributors to financial success. Our focus on high-value activities &mdash; serious fun, meetings, tasks, research, information assurance and IT\\\/Dev workloads &mdash; also will get top-level championship.<\\\/p><p>Culturally, our core values don&rsquo;t change, but how we express them and act day to day must evolve so we work together to win. The keys are the following:<\\\/p><p><i>Nimble<\\\/i><br><\\\/br>In a world of continuous services, the timeframe for product releases, customer interaction and competitive response is dramatically shorter. As a company, we need to make the right decisions, and make them more quickly, balancing all the customer and business imperatives. Each employee must be able to solve problems more quickly and with more real-time data than in the past.<\\\/p><p><i>Communicative<\\\/i><br><\\\/br>In the new, rapid-turn world, we need to communicate in ways that don&rsquo;t just exchange information but drive agility, action, ownership and accountability.<\\\/p><p><i>Collaborative<\\\/i><br><\\\/br>Collaborative doesn&rsquo;t just mean &ldquo;easy to get along with.&rdquo; Collaboration means the ability to coordinate effectively, within and among teams, to get results, build better products faster, and drive customer and shareholder value.<\\\/p><p><i>Decisive<\\\/i><br><\\\/br>As a global company with literally billions of diverse customers in an accelerating business environment, we must have a clear strategic direction but also empower employees closest to the customer to make decisions in service of the larger mission. This is tricky in a big company, but it is the key to higher levels of productivity, growth and customer satisfaction.<\\\/p><p><i>Motivated<\\\/i><br><\\\/br>In our industry, every day brings more challenges and more opportunities than the day before. But we have a unique chance to make the lives of billions of people better in fundamental ways. This should inspire all of us &mdash; those who love making products and services, those who love engaging with customers, and those who love planning and running our company in the most effective way possible. We want people who get up each morning excited to make Microsoft better &mdash; that&rsquo;s how we come closer to fulfilling the potential of all people around the globe.<\\\/p><p>Our leadership team has discussed these cultural aspects a lot and is committed. In my own staff meetings, we are modeling these new characteristics yet also find ourselves occasionally slipping back. One strategy, united together, with great communication, decisiveness and positive energy is the only way to fly.<\\\/p><p><b>Seizing Our Unique Opportunity<\\\/b><br><\\\/br>Together, we have created great products and great success, but we all want more. That means a strategy to deliver a family of devices and services that best enable people for the activities they value most and the enterprise extensions and services that are most valuable to business. A new structure to bring these to market faster. Stronger centralized services so we can be more efficient and effective. Priority focus areas, short and long term. New characteristics of how we work together. In other words, better execution and innovation through strategy and goal and discipline and engineering coherence. One Microsoft all the time.<\\\/p><p>Across Microsoft, we are facing incredible new opportunities. As devices become further integrated into everyday life, we will have to create new and extraordinary experiences for our customers on these devices. We are going to focus on completely reinventing experiences like creating or viewing a creative document and what it means to communicate socially at home or in meetings at work. We are going to immerse people in deep entertainment experiences that let them have serious fun in ways so intense and delightful that they will blur the line between reality and fantasy. And as we develop these new experiences, we will also support our developers with the simplest ways to develop apps or cloud services and integrate with our products. We will help businesses that find themselves in a new world of ever-mounting information to manage that information through greater enterprise information assurance. We will make these high-value activities priorities in our strategy.<\\\/p><p>Lots of change. But in all of this, many key things remains the same. Our incredible people, our spirit, our commitment, our belief in the transformative power of technology &mdash; our Microsoft technology &mdash; to make the world a better place for billions of people and millions of businesses around the world. It&rsquo;s why I come to work inspired every day. It&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve evolved before, and why we&rsquo;re evolving now. Because we&rsquo;re not done.<\\\/p><p>Let&rsquo;s go.<\\\/p><p>Steve<br><\\\/br>-----<\\\/p><p><br><\\\/br><a data-lightview-group=\\\"iclarified\\\" data-lightview-options=\\\"skin: 'mac'\\\" href=\\\"http:\\\/\\\/www.iClarified.com\\\/entry\\\/lightview.php?location=\\\/images\\\/news\\\/31841\\\/130244\\\/130244-1280.jpg\\\"><img alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" height=\\\"360\\\" src=\\\"http:\\\/\\\/www.iClarified.com\\\/images\\\/news\\\/31841\\\/130244\\\/130244-1280.jpg\\\" width=\\\"640\\\"><\\\/img><\\\/a><\\\/p><\\\/div>\",\"date\":\"Thu, 11 Jul 2013 14:00:00 GMT\",\"type\":\"article\",\"media\":[{\"link\":\"http:\\\/\\\/www.iClarified.com\\\/images\\\/news\\\/31841\\\/130244\\\/130244-1280.jpg\",\"primary\":\"true\",\"type\":\"image\"}],\"url\":\"http:\\\/\\\/www.iClarified.com\\\/31841\\\/steve-ballmer-announces-one-microsoft-company-realignment\",\"xpath\":\"\\\/HTML[1]\\\/BODY[1]\\\/DIV[3]\\\/DIV[3]\\\/DIV[1]\\\/DIV[3]\"}\n","code":200},{"headers":[{"name":null,"value":"HTTP\/1.1 200 OK"},{"name":"Transfer-Encoding","value":"chunked"},{"name":"Vary","value":"Accept-Encoding"},{"name":"Date","value":"Fri, 12 Jul 2013 03:54:15 GMT"},{"name":"Content-Type","value":"application\/json;charset=UTF-8"},{"name":"Server","value":"Apache-Coyote\/1.1"}],"body":"{\"summary\":\"The MLB.com At Bat app has been updated for All-Star Week bringing several new features in the process.

At the event, T-Mobile announced a new JUMP program that allows you to upgrade your device whenever you want at subsidized prices. For $10 a month, you can trade in to a new phone at most twice every 12 months. You pay the same price as a new customer would if you decide to sign up for the JUMP program. Note that you do have to trade in your phone in order to get a new device at subsidized pricing.\\nJUMP! from T-Mobile is designed to provide customers with total protection for one of their prized possessions: their smartphones. It offers the freedom to upgrade to a new device more affordably and protects against malfunction, damage, loss or theft - all for just $10 per month, per phone (plus taxes and fees). That's just $2 more than most customers have been paying for handset protection alone.\\nBeginning Sunday, July 14, customers can choose to upgrade when they want, not when they're told with JUMP! Here's how it works: Customers can upgrade to a new phone, financed through T-Mobile's Equipment Installment Program (EIP), twice every 12 months after they've been in the JUMP! program for six months. Simply trade in an eligible T-Mobile phone in good working condition at a participating store location. Any remaining EIP payments will be eliminated, and current customers can purchase new phones for the same upfront pricing as new customers, with device financing and Simple Choice Plan, a no-annual-service contract. With JUMP!, current customers never pay more for their new phones than new customers.\\nThe carrier also announced that their 4G LTE network has been expanded to reach 157 million people in 116 markets.\\nMajor metropolitan areas where T-Mobile's 4G LTE network service has launched include New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, Dallas, Seattle, Atlanta, Miami, and many others. The company debuted 4G LTE less than four months ago.\\nT-Mobile remains on target to deliver nationwide 4G LTE network coverage by the end of the year, reaching 200 million people in more than 200 metropolitan areas. In addition, T-Mobile's 4G HSPA+ network service is available to 228 million people nationwide. By combining 4G HSPA+ and LTE network technologies, T-Mobile can provide customers with a strong, seamless nationwide 4G network experience.\\nFinally the company also announced available for three new devices: The Xperia Z from Sony, Nokia Lumia 925 and the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1. The carrier is also introducing a new Family Plan for those with less than stellar credit.\\nBeginning July 14, families can get four Simple Choice Plan lines with unlimited talk, text and Web and up to 500MB of high-speed data for only $100 per month (plus taxes and fees) - no credit check and no annual service contract required.\\nRead More\\nShare\",\"title\":\"T-Mobile Announces New 'Jump' Program, LTE Expansion and More\",\"html\":\"<div id=\\\"left_column\\\"><div id=\\\"article_titlebar\\\"><p>\\n            \\t<\\\/p><div id=\\\"article_share\\\"><div><\\\/div><div><a href=\\\"http:\\\/\\\/www.iClarified.com\\\/entry\\\/email.php?enid=31820\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><img border=\\\"0\\\" height=\\\"21\\\" src=\\\"http:\\\/\\\/www.iClarified.com\\\/images\\\/icons\\\/email-32.png\\\"><\\\/img><\\\/a><\\\/div><div><a href=\\\"http:\\\/\\\/digg.com\\\/submit?phase=2&url=http:\\\/\\\/www.iclarified.com\\\/31820\\\/tmobile-announces-new-jump-program-lte-expansion-and-more&title=T-Mobile Announces New 'Jump' Program, LTE Expansion and More&bodytext=T-Mobile has announced a new Jump program that allows you to upgrade your device at any time&topic=apple\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><img border=\\\"0\\\" height=\\\"21\\\" src=\\\"http:\\\/\\\/www.iClarified.com\\\/images\\\/icons\\\/digg-32.png\\\"><\\\/img><\\\/a><\\\/div><div><a href=\\\"http:\\\/\\\/www.reddit.com\\\/submit?url=http:\\\/\\\/www.iClarified.com\\\/31820&title=T-Mobile Announces New 'Jump' Program, LTE Expansion and More\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><img border=\\\"0\\\" height=\\\"21\\\" src=\\\"http:\\\/\\\/www.iClarified.com\\\/images\\\/icons\\\/reddit-32.png\\\"><\\\/img><\\\/a><\\\/div><div><a href=\\\"http:\\\/\\\/www.stumbleupon.com\\\/submit?url=http:\\\/\\\/www.iclarified.com\\\/31820\\\/tmobile-announces-new-jump-program-lte-expansion-and-more&title=T-Mobile Announces New 'Jump' Program, LTE Expansion and More\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><img border=\\\"0\\\" height=\\\"21\\\" src=\\\"http:\\\/\\\/www.iClarified.com\\\/images\\\/icons\\\/stumbleupon-32.png\\\"><\\\/img><\\\/a><\\\/div><div><a href=\\\"http:\\\/\\\/del.icio.us\\\/post\\\" onclick=\\\"window.open('http:\\\/\\\/del.icio.us\\\/post?v=4&noui&jump=close&url='+encodeURIComponent(location.href)+'&title='+encodeURIComponent(document.title), 'delicious','toolbar=no,width=700,height=400'); return false;\\\"><img border=\\\"0\\\" height=\\\"21\\\" src=\\\"http:\\\/\\\/www.iClarified.com\\\/images\\\/icons\\\/delicious-32.png\\\"><\\\/img><\\\/a><\\\/div><\\\/div><\\\/div><div><p style=\\\"display:inline;\\\">Posted July 10, 2013 at 7:19pm by <\\\/p><span id=\\\"document_author\\\">iClarified<\\\/span><p style=\\\"display:inline;\\\"> | Please help us and submit a translation by clicking <\\\/p><a href=\\\"http:\\\/\\\/www.iClarified.com\\\/translate\\\/index.php?enid=31820\\\"><strong>here<\\\/strong><\\\/a><p style=\\\"display:inline;\\\"> | 5013 views\\n        \\t<\\\/p><\\\/div><div id=\\\"article_body\\\"><p>T-Mobile held an event today, which the carrier claimed would be their 'boldest move yet.'
